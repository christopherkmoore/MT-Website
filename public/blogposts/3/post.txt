### Maybe AI is coming for your job...
I used a lorem ipsum generator with a unique flavor to generate a paragraph of text... Then I told Llama 3.2 to write me a blog post using the following prompt. Without proper direction, the result was a near podcast length of LinkedIn flavored bs you'd never want to see. But a bit of direction went a long way:

```code
write a linkedin 200 word blog post using this as inspiration:

I'm baby semiotics JOMO yuccie, microdosing prism gentrify tumeric stumptown mukbang.
Shabby chic scenester subway tile pork belly air plant vape art party bushwick 
tumeric man bun marfa gentrify la croix small batch distillery. Hoodie seitan tilde 
four dollar toast. Neutral milk hotel tattooed DIY whatever portland chartreuse distillery.

try to be funny and show wit. it doesn't have to make sense.
```
I would have preferred a more vape-heavy TikTok style banger but what I got wasn't horrible:

```code 
As someone who's been around the block a few times, I've noticed that there's a certain code that exists 
among the self-actualized. It's like a secret handshake, but with more artisanal coffee and less small talk.

If you're not familiar with this dialect, don't worry – it's not like you need to know how to order a 
pour-over at a local café just to get by in life. But if you want to be part of the in-crowd, 
here are some essential phrases to learn:

-   "Lowkey obsessed with my morning routine" means "I'm trying to adult."
-   "Highkey loving this avocado toast" translates to "I have no idea what I'm doing with my life."
-   And if someone says they're "manifesting their dreams," just nod politely and offer them a gluten-free muffin.

So, there you have it – the language of the self-actualized in a nutshell. Or should I say, in a reusable water bottle?
```

I'd say AI is like 30% away from taking your job, so you have time.
