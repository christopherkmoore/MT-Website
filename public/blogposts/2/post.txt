### Why won't my amplify deploy my markdown file!

While I was creating this blog, I had one heck of a time trying to render a .md file into a react component -- here are the pain points
- You need to import a library to render the markdown `react-markdown`
- That renderer doesn't actually apply styles ðŸ™ˆ
-   ***Your server won't want to actually serve the MD file***

The first two are easily solvable with searches, luckily react has plenty of support that allow you to fix this problem quickly.

What's more frustrating is trying to understand why you can easily fetch and serve a file on localhost, but once it's deployed to AWS Amplify, and the image is served from AWS S3, it no longer works.

I still don't know the answer to the question, and if someone does, please email me to let me know!

However, an easy workaround is this:
**just serve the file as a .txt instead of a .md**

Sometimes it's easier to think around the solution than it is to think through the solution.
